	<h1>Known bugs & limitations</h1>
	
	<p>
	These are things that do not work (yet :-)
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			No maximize support. I'm still not completely happy with the code,
			so it's currently disabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			Running tabs under different credentials. I plan to support 'run 
			as' for tabs, but it will have to wait for the next version.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support for complex scripts (like Chinese CJK) I don't have much
			experience with this, so I need some time to investigate.
		</li>
		<li>
			Full screen mode. ALT+ENTER will switch full screen mode for the 
			hidden console window.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are several minor bugs and feature requests listed on 
			project's Sourceforge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console">
			page</a>. You can monitor their status there. I will try to 
			fix/implement them as time permits...
		</li>
	<ul>
